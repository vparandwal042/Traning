            <h1>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained the Indian team in 
                limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. An attacking right-handed middle-order 
                batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made 
                his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later 
                against Sri Lanka.

        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>December 23, 2004: Makes his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong. Is run out for 0 after facing one ball, in a 
                match India win by 11 runs.</li>
            <li>April 5, 2005: The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper. After scores of 0, 12, 7* and 3, Dhoni is sent up the 
                order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and proceeds to smash 148 off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, 
                setting the platform for India's 356/9. The world wakes up to Dhoni's potential.</li>
            <li>October 31, 2005: Dhoni stamps himself into the history books with a record 183* against Sri Lanka in Jaipur, helping 
                India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare. Batting at No 3, his 145-ball hundred makes a stiff target
                 look well short and India go up 3-0 in the best-of-seven series.</li>
            <li>September 13, 2007: Dhoni's first international match in charge of India is a wash out against Scotland in their ICC 
                World Twenty20 opener. Few could have predicted how India's tournament will pan out.</li>
            <li>September 24, 2007: India win the inaugural World Twenty20 by beating Pakistan in an absolute humdinger in Johannesburg. 
                Dhoni is an overnight sensation once more and the landscape of T20 cricket is changed forever.</li>

                by 84 runs to fall behind 0-1 in the seven-match series.</li>
            <li>November 15, 2007: First ODI series win for Dhoni as captain, as India beat Pakistan by six wickets in Gwalior to take the lead

            <li>March 4, 2008: A momentous occasion for India as they win their first ODI series in Australia. The landmark comes in the second
